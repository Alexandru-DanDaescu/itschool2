The family Ursidae is one of nine families in the suborder Caniformia, or "doglike" carnivorans, within the order Carnivora.
Bears' closest living relatives are the pinnipeds, canids, and musteloids.
Modern bears comprise eight species in three subfamilies: Ailuropodinae (monotypic with the giant panda),
Tremarctinae (monotypic with the spectacled bear),
and Ursinae (containing six species divided into one to three genera, depending on the authority).
Nuclear chromosome analysis show that the karyotype of the six ursine bears is nearly identical,
each having 74 chromosomes (see Ursid hybrid), whereas the giant panda has 42 chromosomes and the spectacled bear 52.
These smaller numbers can be explained by the fusing of some chromosomes,
and the banding patterns on these match those of the ursine species, but differ from those of procyonids,
which supports the inclusion of these two species in Ursidae rather than in Procyonidae,
where they had been placed by some earlier authorities.
