18.XML to JSON Conversion using External Library
Description:

You are tasked with creating a Java application that reads an XML file and converts it to a JSON format. Utilize an
external library such as Jackson or Gson to facilitate the XML to JSON conversion. Your application should be capable of
handling complex XML structures with nested elements.

This processor can be considered a module of your entire project and should be done in a package under sessionX -
homework/challenges packages.

On the next slide there is an example of an XML file that your application should be able to process.
