15.Create a functional interface named ListFilter that works with generics. It should have a method that takes a list of
elements of type T and a predicate functional interface, applying the predicate to filter elements of the list,
returning a new list with elements that satisfy the predicate condition. Implement the ListFilter using a lambda
expression and demonstrate its usage with different types of lists and predicates.
